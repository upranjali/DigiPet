  <h1>Digital Pet NFT</h1>

  <h2>Project Description</h2>
  <p>Digital Pet NFT is an innovative blockchain-based virtual pet system built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. Each pet is represented as a unique Non-Fungible Token (NFT) that evolves and grows based on user interactions. Players can mint, care for, and nurture their digital pets, watching them transform through different evolutionary stages from egg to legendary status.</p>
  <p>The pets have dynamic attributes including experience points, happiness levels, and evolutionary stages that change based on how frequently and lovingly users interact with them. This creates an engaging, gamified experience where consistent care and attention are rewarded with pet growth and evolution.</p>

  <h2>Key Features</h2>
  <h3>Dynamic Evolution System</h3>
  <p>Four distinct stages: Egg → Baby → Adult → Legendary. Evolution triggered by experience points and happiness levels. Each stage unlocks new visual traits and capabilities.</p>

  <h3>Interactive Gameplay</h3>
  <p>Multiple interaction types (feed, play, care). Real-time experience and happiness tracking. Rewards consistent engagement with pet growth.</p>

  <h3>True NFT Ownership</h3>
  <p>Each pet is a unique, ownable NFT on Stacks blockchain. Dynamic metadata that changes as pets evolve. Verifiable ownership and transfer capabilities.</p>

  <h3>Pet Analytics</h3>
  <p>Track interaction history and evolution progress. Monitor pet happiness and attention needs. View detailed pet statistics and growth metrics.</p>

  <h3>Secure & Transparent</h3>
  <p>Built on Stacks blockchain with Clarity smart contracts. All interactions and evolutions recorded on-chain. Owner-only pet interaction system with built-in security.</p>
